Assignment 3 : Parts System w/ Database compatibility 

Notes by Daniel Gardner

I did this assignment by myself. The Detail Part view is combined with the Part list view into one JFrame, and same with the Inventory view in its own JFrame. All of the input in the system is used as Strings for the database. Clicking on a part or item in the above list automatically fills in the fields in the lower half of the JFrame for easy editing. The records in the database get called every time an update is made, so the two lists always reflect what is currently in the database.
